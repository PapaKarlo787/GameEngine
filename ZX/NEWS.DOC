Release 2.51. (December 1998)
=============================

The difference in the release number is small, because the new release has not
so many new features. However, the difference in the program is not small,
because more than 20 bugfixes are introduced, some of them was very serious.

- Starting from release 2.51, the Warajevo emulator has the official home page
  (thanks to Martijn Van Der Heidne), where you can find a lot of interesting
  things (the most of them are related to the Warajevo, but some of them are
  not). The URL is:

  http://www.void.demon.nl/warajevo/index.html

- A fatal bug which cause "Runtime error 200" on very fast computers is fixed
  (in fact, this is a bug in the Turbo Pascal, not in the Warajevo itself).

- Some bugs in TZX loading with the programs which require silence at the end
  of loading (some speedlocks, like the Arkanoid) are fixed. Thanks to Uros
  Zupan to noticing this. Before, the success of loading such programs was
  random (somebody may tell that this was a good emulation, because it is also
  true on the real Spectrum)...

- Another TZX bug which prevents loading of some tapes with mixture of normal
  and sampled blocks is also fixed (noticed in Slovenian programs The Drinker
  and Jamski heroj).

- An ugly bug which may cause loading error during loading from the samples or
  TZX files if a function key is pressed during the loading (even a harmless
  key like F4 or F6) is fixed.

- Another stupid bug which cause crash if the help key (F1) is pressed during
  loading from samples is fixed.

- TZX loading is now much faster when the "Sample standard blocks rather than
  copy them" checkbox is turned off than in previous release. The same is true
  for loading from TAP files which are mixture of normal and sampled blocks.

- Loading from the samples now works correctly on the Timex version of the
  emulator too.

- Very nasty bug which prevents starting programs from the ZIP archives using
  the 'Start' button is fixed.

- A bug in AY sound using the Sound Blaster when one of the sound registers is
  set to produce ultrasound is fixed (noticed in Cybernoid 128). Thanks to Lee
  Tonks for noticing this.

- A bug which stops screen generation if the multicolor and hires border
  emulation is turned on using command swithches in maximal speed mode or on
  non-VGA graphic cards is fixed.

- The multicolor emulation is a bit improved: the multicolor effects in the
  Zynaps now works correctly.

- An user-definable color palette (via the WARAJEVO.PAL file) is included, and
  the default palette is now much more similar to original Spectrum palette
  than in previous version.

- A bug which may cause crash if the Z80 interrupt request appears during
  execution of 80x86 escape sequences is fixed.

- The option "Merge Dock" in the environment did not work. This is fixed now.

- The option "View Dock" in the environment showed incorrect informations. Now
  fixed.

- The "Object not initialized" bug, when SGD.INI file is not present while
  converting the data base from the SGD format to the Warajevo format is
  fixed.

- The conversion from the SGD to the Warajevo now treats correctly non-native
  Warajevo file formats.

- 3 checkboxes are added in the option for converting the SGD to the Warajevo
  database, to ignore sorting, producer names and file names if the database
  is too huge, what is a case with "World of Spectrum" database archive. These
  items are stored in RAM memory, and without sorting and producer names
  Warajevo now can handle not only GAMES.DAT, but also complete SGD database
  (90K still remains free).

- A bug with reclaiming allocated memory in "DockFiles" menu is now fixed.

- The fatal error raporting in the environment now don't cause screen trashing
  if the environment is in the graphic mode.

- The amount of free RAM in the environment is increased for about 10K.

- On the Timex version of the emulator, you could not load blocks at addresses
  0-16383 even if there is a RAM there, and everything could be loaded at
  addresses above 16384 even if there is a ROM there. This is now fixed.

- Some I/O ports on the Timex emulator could not be virtualized (247, 239 and
  231 for both reading and writting, and 31 and 245 for reading) using the
  external drivers. This is fixed now.

- One ugly bug in ZXCOMP is fixed: starting from ZXCOMP release 2.0, the extra
  instructions for saving/loading blocks does not work and causes a crash. This
  is now fixed.

- Another ZXCOMP bug is fixed: switch /Q in the ZXCOMP now works...

- The ZXCOMP block load instruction is improved: when DE=0, the whole block
  will be loaded from the disc regardless of its actual length.

- File WARICONS.ZIP is replaced with ICO&PIFS.ZIP, and it now contains also
  PIF files for better working under Windows 95.

- Some errors in the documentation (not gramatic but principal errors) are now
  fixed, and the FAQ list is updated.

- The documentation in Bosnian language is not longer supported with the
  Warajevo package. Instead, it can be downloaded separately from the Warajevo
  home page.


Release 2.5. (October 1998)
===========================

As usual, Warajevo 2.5. introduced a lot of new features:

- Warajevo 2.5. includes emulation of the American release of the Spectrum,
  the Timex Sinclair 2068. Nearly all of the features of this computer
  (except disk interfaces) are implemented, including extra video modes,
  joystick interface, sound chip, bank switching hardware, RAM/ROM cartridge
  expansions, LROS and AROS programs, TS 2048 printer and AERCO printer
  interface, etc.

- Improved TZX file compatibility: all tested TZX files (about 500) now work.
  Warajevo can now handle TZX files with blocks longer than 64K (Skool Daze
  for example). A very serious bug which sometimes caused the loss of one bit
  at TZX block boundaries (the main reason for TZX incompatibility) is now
  removed (noticed in Robocop, 10th Frame etc.). The TZX Select block is
  still not implemented, but now it will not fool the emulator (noticed in
  Batman 3).

- Much faster TZX conversion. The rules of TZX conversion may be customized,
  so you may decide between maximal compatibility and slower loading, or
  fast loading with less compatibility...

- Switch /%LMAX is implemented, which makes loading using non-standard
  loaders (TZX files, tone samples, edge recognizer etc.) much faster (on
  100 MHz machine four times faster or more) without any degradation in
  compatibility.

- Improved AY sound emulation on Sound Blaster: exact emulation of the AY
  chip is implemented, including the variable-frequency noise generator,
  digital sound effects and speech generation. In most cases, the sound is
  the same as in the X128 emulator (SAOM version) which needs higher hardware
  requirements on your computer than the Warajevo emulator. AdLib
  compatibility is improved: a switch (/SO) is introduced to achieve maximal
  compatibility with very old sound cards which use the OPL2 chip for FM
  synthesis.

- Warajevo 2.5. implements one exotic sound emulation mode: with the switch
  /SX it tries to emulate all of the AY features (noise, digital sound etc.)
  using only the PC beeper! Sometimes it sounds quite good.

- Emulation of multicolor effects (switch /QX) is implemented: the well-known
  Overscan demo and many other multicolor programs now work quite well. At
  the moment, there is only one emulator which has a better emulation of
  such effects: ZX32 for Windows 95 by Vaggelis Kapartzianis.

- Warajevo 2.5. allows direct loading and saving from the emulator kernel
  using a real tape recorder through a LPT1 port (both loading and saving) or
  a Sound Blaster card (loading only), like the registered version of
  Lunter's Z80 emulator. But unlike Lunter's program, in the Warajevo
  emulator you can see the loading screens etc. during loading!

- The environment of Warajevo 2.5. has an option for sampling the tone record
  from a real tape into a TAP file, regardless of the structure of the tone
  record and loading routine. In other words, you can transfer any program
  from real tape to a TAP file!

- The conversion between the SpecBase and the Warajevo database format is
  implemented.

- A switch (/EO) is implemented which allows programs which need the old ZX
  Interface 1 ROM (like Trans Express, Easyuse Microdrive Utility, Beta Basic
  3.0 etc.) to work correctly.

- The 'Start' button does not allow selection of a file which is not a
  Spectrum-related file.

- 48K snapshot files may be loaded into the 128K version of the emulator
  without errors and conversions. Also, switching from the 48K version to the
  128K version may be done without resetting the emulator.

- The utility MAKEREG is introduced which helps by registering Spectrum files
  with the emulator in Windows 95. Also, a separate icon file for each file
  type category has been designed.

- Task switching to the emulator on MS Windows will not cause trash on the
  screen (if you select the appropriate option to enable this feature). Also,
  some options are introduced for better MS Windows compatibility.

- The command Dx y z 1 in the built-in monitor now also displays ASCII
  characters and BASIC tokens, which is very useful for analysing protected
  BASIC programs. The monitor may access all the Timex extra memory banks,
  and some small improvements are also introduced.

- Exact behaviour of the self-modified Z80 CALL instruction is implemented,
  so some more programs now work (Batman DE).

- The switches /@ and /@@ which help various kinds of batch testing are
  introduced.

- Warajevo 2.5. can disable picture generation using Shift+F6, which helps
  loading from real tape on slower computers.

- The switch /H is now obsolete; loading from emulated tape is quite
  aesthetic, regardless of the setting of the /H switch, without any
  drawbacks.

- You can exit the emulator pressing Alt+F4, like in Windows.

- The help screen (F1) is much nicer, and it is now colourful.

- A very dangerous bug in the envelope generator which could hang-up and
  totally lock the emulator has been removed (noticed in War Cars and
  Brain Crash).

- A nasty bug which destroys the DE register after returning from the Tape
  Manager has been fixed.

- A bug which trashed the alternative register set on start-up when the
  option /A is given has been fixed (noticed in RamPage and FireFly).

- The option /K in the 48K version of the emulator now works correctly
  (fixed, but useless).

- The bug which prevented working with read-only files in the environment is
  now fixed.

- Updating of alternate video memory on the 128K now works correctly in all
  cases (noticed in the Hercules demo).

- A bug in the envelope generator which sometimes trashed some melodies is
  removed at last (we've searched for this bug since release 1.1)!

- Lunter TAP files which are shorter than 12 bytes now cannot cause a crash
  in the emulator like in release 2.0.

- A bug which caused screen flashing during loading in synchronous border
  emulation mode has been fixed.

- Conversions to and from the ZXS and ZXT formats, and from the TRD to TAP
  format now works correctly. Thanks to Vaggelis Kapartzianis.

- The option /S<filename> when <filename> does not exist will not cause a
  crash like in release 2.0.

- Different video timing in the 128K version is implemented, and some bugs in
  the timing calculation are fixed, so 128K programs which use border effects
  (El Loco for example) now work correctly (thanks to Miodrag Stancevic).

- In release 2.0. the ULA delay estimation was very often overestimated,
  which may have caused some programs to crash. This is now fixed.

- Bugs in instructions like RRCP (IX+nn),reg are now fixed (noticed in Songs
  In Line 5)

- SA_BYTES routine now returns the correct value of the IX register (noticed
  in one copy program, thanks to Miodrag Stancevic).

- Working with the emulator across the midnight boundary will update the date
  correctly after exiting the emulator (thanks to Daniel Herak).

- The command switch /?86 is now parsed correctly (thanks to Philip Pogosov)

- The environment is now optimized for 286+ processors (and cannot be started
  with an 8086). The design of the items in the help system in the
  environment is closer to the items in the environment itself.

- Many users asked us about the organization of the compressed Warajevo TAP
  files, so information about exact TAP file organization is included in the
  manual.

- The documentation and FAQ list are updated.


Release 2.0. (February 1998)
============================

Release 2.0. had a lot of great and radical improvements:

- Warajevo 2.0. is, at least, real-time emulator, so speed of emulated
  Spectrum programs is like on real Spectrum, independently of speed of your
  machine (no more ugly /W switch)!!! Also, ZXCOMP 2.0. creates executable
  files which are independent of machine speed too.

- Emulation of AY sound chip on 128 version of the emulator is now allowed
  using AdLib compatible sound cards (Sound Blaster for example).

- Warajevo 2.0. supports (without conversion) tape files in Lunter TAP format,
  which now has nearly equality of right with native Warajevo format!

- Command parameter which suppress mixing of 8088 machine code with Z80
  machine code (for users which are afraid about possibility of infiltrating
  a "Trojan horse" into a snapshot file) is implemented.

- Video emulation is improved: Warajevo 2.0. now supports wide class of high
  resolution BORDER effects, and probability of sprite flickering is reduced
  to very low value (for very fine adjustment, switch /Q is implemented).

- The environment of the emulator now can optionally work in graphic mode (put
  command SET WARAJEVO=G into AUTOEXEC.BAT file to do it), which gives more
  professional looking and allows new possibilities like displaying content of
  the emulated screen in the environment window.

- In addition to Lunter TAP support, Warajevo TAP format is also expanded to
  support blocks which contain tape record samples. Indirect support of TZX
  and VOC files are also implemented!

- 128 version of the emulator now emulates MIDI interface using Sound Blaster
  compatible card. So, Warajevo is now the only emulator which emulates MIDI!

- One more exotic thing: Warajevo 2.0. emulator emulates Sinclair Network!

- Interrupt generation is synchronized with real emulator speed, so interrupt
  congesting is impossible, and interrupt frequency has no influence to sprite
  flickering (no more /I switch).

- The environment now may be called from the emulator using right mouse click.

- Options 'Convert' in the environment now supports very wide range of
  different snapshot, tape and mixed formats. Options for converting Warajevo
  databases into (or from) other Spectrum-related databases (for example, ZX
  Rainbow) are now implemented too.

- Converting of snapshot files into TAP file is now much easier to use, and
  supports many new options. Between others, conversion may be performed on
  such way that converted program will be compatible with Lunter's Z80
  emulator (in earlier releases manual modifications into loader was
  necessary), and in some cases, screen corrupting can be totally suppressed.

- Conversion 'Warajevo <-> Lunter' is now less confuse for many users.

- The environment supports Start button (like Windows 95), which allows quick
  running of ZX Spectrum programs independently of their format (Z80, TAP, SNA,
  SLT, BLK, TZX, VOC etc.), even running programs from ZIP archives! So,
  working with Warajevo is no more tedious with non-Z80 files (like SNA).

- Yellow color is now really yellow color...

- Working with Warajevo database is drastically faster. Entering and editing
  linked data in the database is incomparably easier. Database now has some
  new possibilities. Requirements for the free memory space in the environment when
  during tape imploding or during working with the database are reduced.

- Swap files for communications between emulator kernel and the environment
  (SPECSIM.CFG and TEMP.Z80) now may lay on arbitrary drive and directory
  (which allows making runable version of the emulator on CD-ROM). Switching
  between the kernel and the environment is now drastically faster, especially
  when tape file which is currently in use lays on floppy disc.

- Internal monitor has now help page, one new command (N), and some useful
  improvements in the search command (F).

- Opcode #ED #FB (and also #ED #F6) which is so-called Multi-level Load Trap
  on many other emulators (including Lunter's Z80, XZX etc.) is implemented,
  although on one specific way. So, Warajevo 2.0. now indirectly supports SLT
  format too.

- Sound during loading using non-standard loaders (and with standard loaders
  in SLOW tape emulation mode) is more realistic (like on original Spectrum).
  Border effects during slow loading are implemented too.

- Edge recognizer algorithm is a bit improved, so it can recognize broader
  class of loaders.

- Program ZXCOMP now has switch /? for getting a quick help. Compiled programs
  also support switch /? which shows list of other possible switches.

- One bad point in release 2.0: this release needs a bit faster computer than
  release 1.5. (33 MHz or more) for correct working.

- Bug which makes impossible loading programs from tape using Sound Blaster is
  now removed.

- Very serious bug which destroys cartridge file from time to time (but very
  often, in according with Murphy's law) is now removed.

- A stupid bug which corrupt carry flag after tape saving (due to this reason,
  program 'Turbo imploder', when save is requested, save only a header) is now
  removed.

- We believe that bug which sometimes cause crash during palette changing (F5)
  on some computers is removed.

- Bug which causes message 'Internal error - unexpected wrapping' in some cases
  with programs created using ZXCOMP is now removed.

- MS Windows compatibility is quite improved, so programs like 'Dynamite Dan',
  'Galactic Gunners' etc. now works under MS Windows.

- Under Windows 95, Spectrum files (Z80 etc.) may be registered, so double
  click on such files will load and run them.

- Some harmless bugs into the environment are removed. Many options are
  improved and easier to use.

- A lot of other (mostly aesthetic) bugs are removed (but, maybe, a lot of new
  bugs are introduced).

- The documentation is expanded (oh, no), and FAQ list is updated with new
  questions and answers.

- The documentation on Bosnian language now contains Bosnian-specific letters
  (using code page 852).

- Our E-mail addresses in the documentation are changed.

- Icon WARAJEVO.ICO is redesigned.

- This program is still freeware, but now if you donate 80 DM or more, you can
  get source files of whole emulator!


Release 1.5. (July 1996)
========================

Release 1.5. was radically new:

- The most important thing is that emulator, ZXTOOLS and ZXSHELL now makes one
  compact, completely redesigned, logical unit. You now can do all things
  directly from emulator, with user-friendly user interface (without needs for
  command switches), including loading programs through menus. User interface
  supports mouse.

- Now it is possible to load programs directly from a real tape using a real
  tape recorder.

- Completely new method of picture generation success to remove flickering
  practically in all programs (using simple changes of some parameters). Sound
  quality is retained. Picture repainting on old graphic cards (Hercules) is
  drastically faster, especially with /VX parameter. Option /X no longer
  exists.

- Kernel of emulator is rewritten, so on slower machines emulator is about
  30-60 % faster. This improves range of machines on which emulator is usable.
  Also, /I option is less needed now.

- ZXCOMP is also rewritten, so we think that now there is no some ugly bugs
  into it.

- Shades for monochromatic graphic card are redesigned, so many games which
  was unplayable on such cards are now playable.

- Microdrive emulation on I/O level (very realistic) is implemented, with
  variable size cartridge files (5-126 KB).

- ZX printer is now emulated on HP Laser Jet printer too. Also, in earlier
  releases of emulator, on some computers emulator wrongly detects presence of
  printer which is not present. Sometimes that may cause problems. Now,
  printer emulation is disable by default, and must be enabled (if need) using
  appropriate command.

- MS Windows compatibility is improved. Now it is possible to have color
  picture in window (unfortunately not in natural Spectrum colours, in fact
  this is color CGA mode). Three different color combinations are supported.

- On CGA card FLASH is now implemented as inverse character (so option /K is
  useless). CGA card is now not in usage, but this feature is important for
  windowed running on MS Windows, because only CGA mode may be used in
  windowed mode.

- A method which supports adding external drivers for emulation of peripheral
  devices which are not initially emulated by emulator is implemented. As
  example, driver for Kempston parallel Centronics interface emulation came
  with emulator (with object and source code in assembler).

- Emulator now implements method which allows mixing of 8088 machine code with
  Z80 code (Who will use it? Somebody who want to modify Sabre Wulf to save
  high score to disk, for example). It is now possible to patch into Z80 code
  sequence of instructions which will be execute directly in 8088 code, so
  user may implement things which cannot be implemented directly in emulator
  (for example, screen saving directly into disk file). This is very useful in
  compiled snapshots (ZXCOMP).

- Emulator now correctly emulate all Z80 flags which is marked as '?' in Z80
  manual, for example S flag after BIT instruction (Sabre Wulf now works as on
  original Spectrum). Also, partially emulation of bits 3 and 5 in F register
  is implemented (so now Ghost'n Goblins works). These things are implemented
  without any losing of emulator performances.

- Configuration file SPECSIM.CFG now may have more than one line, and may be
  longer than 128 bytes. This file now has locally nature, and globally
  configuration file DEFAULT.CFG is implemented.

- Now there is different error message when snapshot file is absent and when
  snapshot file has wrong format.

- Critical error handler is improved, so message 'Critical error was fatal' no
  longer exists.

- Keys PageUp and PageDown in tape manager will not hang up emulator if TAP
  file format is wrong. Tape Manager now displays block position in tape
  (useful for /F option), and some small bugs are removed.

- Background colour for Tape Manager and machine monitor is changed. We seen
  on color monitor that new background is better for eyes.

- We hope that keyboard problems on some machines no longer exists.

- Method for initialization graphic mode on EGA and VGA card is improved, so we
  hope (but there is no guarantee) that emulator now works on all EGA and VGA
  graphic cards.

- Bug into emulation of seventh bit of R register which block some games is
  now removed (for example, Bruce Lee).

- Some small bugs into I/O ports emulation are removed. BUS IDLE port
  emulation is improved.

- Option /W is improved and now not interfere with BUS IDLE port emulation and
  R register emulation.

- Documentation is about 60% longer. A list FAQ (Frequently asked questions)
  is added into the package (but list TESTED.LST is removed).


Release 1.4. (March 1996)
=========================

This was one internal release (incomplete release 1.5.) which was Samir's
graduate thesis.


Release 1.2. (December 1995)
============================

Release 1.2. was mostly a bugfixed version with new ZXTOOLS:

- Removed bug with keyboard hanging on some controllers and BIOS-es. The bug is
  removed by Rui Fernando Ribeiro from Portugal.

- ZXTOOLS is completely redesigned. It has new user interface with windows and
  menus. It is much more easy to reach most of options (for example, in
  version 1.1. the option 'Copy to New' was real nightmare). The user
  interface is similar to one in Borland's compilers or Norton utilities. We
  supported conversion to formats of many other PC based Spectrum emulators,
  but also conversion from them. Other than TAP files, ZXTOOLS supports also
  snapshot files, changing of them and conversion to snapshot formats of other
  emulators. Conversion of snapshot files to TAP format is supported. The
  loader is flexible and allows easy transferring of program in tape file to
  disc or microdrive.

- The list TESTED.LST enlarged for 35 new programs.


Release 1.11. (May 1995)
========================

In this version we removed some bugs noticed into release 1.1.:

- Option Z in monitor (screen copy) now works with any graphic cards and with
  any Epson compatible printer too.

- ZX printer emulation now works with any Epson compatible printer.

- Emulator now can correctly load .Z80 snapshots which are in old Lunter's
  format (i.e. created using Lunter's emulator version 1.45 or older).

- Option for converting screens to color TIFF format into ZXTOOLS now works.

- Compiling snapshots which have BASIC part using ZXCOMP was practically
  impossible, due to bug into ZXCOMP. This bug is removed now.

- E-mail addresses in documentation are changed.

- Additional informations for Windows users and added Windows icon.


Release 1.1. (March 1995)
=========================

Release 1.1. had a great improvements:

- Full emulation of memory management on Spectrum 128 is implemented,
  including two algorithms for emulating alternative video bank (option /X).
  Emulation of AY sound chip through PC beeper (pseudo 3-channel sound) is
  implemented, with corresponding command line option (option /S). Emulator now
  supports emulation of Spectrum +2 (option /2).

- KEYPAD emulation is implemented in 128 version of emulator. Keyboard is
  expanded with keys 'Esc' (acts as BREAK) and '~' (acts as FIRE button on
  joystick, same as grey '+' key).

- Emulator now detects presence of 80386 processor and speed up twice memory
  paging if 80386 is present. Emulator more rarely cause conflict with
  programs like EMM386, Windows, etc. Warning message will be displayed if
  processor works in 'Virtual 8086' mode, and it may be suppressed (using
  option /!).

- We now make program ZXCOMP which can compile Z80 snapshot files into EXE
  programs which can work totally independently of the emulator.

- Tape emulation is improved. Fast block loading returns more accurately
  register values than in previous release of emulator. During slow loading,
  you now can break loading using BREAK if recognized routine is breakable, or
  not if recognized routine is not breakable. Option /L is implemented, which
  allows setting algorithm for tape emulation at start of the emulator. Option
  /O, which sets 'filter' for active tapes is implemented. We now deliver
  'Turbo copy' program for cracking some protected programs with emulator.

- Option /M, which allows setting algorithm for attributes emulation at start
  of the emulator is implemented. Treatment of keys F5 and F6 is improved. On
  Hercules card now exist extended mode (option /VX). Command V in monitor now
  do not deactivate FLASH.

- Greatest improvements are done in the monitor. Command B without parameters
  now clears breakpoint. Command A (Abort) is improved very much, especially
  in 128 version of the emulator. Commands Y (for memory management) and J
  (for executing programs till specified address) are implemented. Breakpoint
  now destroys only one byte in memory, when you leave the monitor. Command E
  now may have parameter. ARG field now will be empty if current instruction
  has no memory arguments, and monitor displays state of '48K Lock' bit too.
  Command A now cause error message if you try to put RAMPTOP at too low
  address. Break point now may be put into any memory page (and it will be
  displayed on front panel). Treatment of inline parameters after instructions
  RST is implemented, and accordingly command D got fourth parameter. Command
  T now makes difference between codes below and above 128 while displaying
  them on the screen. Command ! which sets interrupt flip-flops and interrupt
  mode is implemented. Command S now can save parts of memory with header, not
  only as headerless files. Command Z is implemented, which gives great
  possibilities for dumping screens to the printer, in different shapes and
  sizes. Finally, using command O you can now redirect output from monitor to
  file 'MONITOR.OUT' so results of working into monitor need not be captured
  in it.

- Automatic loading of programs from TAP files is improved very much,
  especially in 128 version of emulator. The most important thing is that user
  now can not press BREAK before ROM changes is cancelled. For pedant users we
  implemented options /Y and /H.

- We now implemented RS232 emulation through Interface 1 (earlier we have only
  emulation through 128 RS232 port) to LPT1 port. For ZX printer emulation we
  implemented option /P (earlier it was default). Option /EX is implemented
  too.

- Option /B is expanded, so it has influence to RST 40 in Derby ROM on 128
  version of the emulator, and now may be used together with option /E. Option
  /I now may have parameter, and has no influence to flashing speed. Option /C
  now may be used together with other options.

- Errors treatment is improved. Emulator now displays more detail informations
  about place where the error occurred. Greater improvements are done with DOS
  critical errors, so critical errors more rarely cause stopping of the
  emulator.

- Speed adjustment is now implemented (option /W), but on relatively primitive
  way. Auxiliary program MEASURE.COM is included in the package, as a help for
  correct using of option /W.

- In program ZXSHELL we expanded field for start-up options, support of many
  printers is included, and we implemented commands for easier adding or
  deleting initial switches. Entering some fields in the database is improved.
  Displaying of troubles in reports is improved.

- Emulator now can load snapshot files created by version 3.0. of Lunter's
  'Z80' emulator, not only by version 2.0.

- Calibration of analogue PC joystick is implemented. Options for joystick
  emulation which may exist together now don't exclude one another.

- Detailed documentation on Bosnian and (not very good) English language is
  included in the package. Also, some lectures in messages in ZXTOOLS and
  ZXSHELL programs are made.


Release 1.01. (January 1995)
============================

In this version we removed a lot of bugs which was in version 1.0. The
greatest bugs was:

- Bugs with breakpoints and I command into monitor, as bugs with changing of A
  register into monitor.

- Some dangerous bugs in 'edge recognizer' algorithm and loading of snapshot
  files.

- Problems with blocking if you wait too long while title picture is shown of
  screen.

- Some command line options (for example, /B) very often didn't work.


Release 1.0. (November 1994)
============================

This release was the first complete version of this program. In this release
we completed some half-implemented features and sent program to Gerton Lunter.
