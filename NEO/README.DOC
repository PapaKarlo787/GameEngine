ABOUT NEOPAINT
--------------

NeoPaint is the ultimate image editing program for DOS!
Until now sophisticated image editing has required
spending hundreds of dollars on software and hardware. At
$45 (U.S.), NeoPaint sets a new standard in
price/performance. NeoPaint is as simple to use as any
paint program, yet with many powerful features usually
found only in high-end picture publishing systems. Better
still, NeoPaint is NOT a Microsoft Windows program, so
it's easy to install, set up and use. NeoPaint's state of
the art GUI interface allows you to edit and view
multiple images at the same time in resolutions as high
as 1024x768.

When you compare NeoPaint with high end graphics packages
costing hundreds of dollars we think you'll discover that
NeoPaint gives you tremendous power at any price!

o   Option added to the Airbrush Setup that allows the
    airbrush to fade from one color to another.
o   We've also added dozens of other small enhancements
    not listed here...

The following features are new to version 3.1:

o   Added support for 32K and 64K High Color video modes.

o   Removed support for GIF image files. Unisys, patent
    holder for the LZW compression used in this format,
    required that royalties be paid for every copy of
    NeoPaint sold after January 1, 1995. Since everyone
    had been led to believe that GIF was a free public
    domain format, we felt that it was unfair to suddenly
    require royalties. If royalties had been required
    since GIF's introduction, it would never have
    attained the level of popularity it now enjoys.

The following features are new to version 3.2:

o   Restored support for GIF images files. NeoSoft and
    Unisys, patent holder for the LZW compression used in
    GIF files, reached an agreement that allows NeoPaint
    to once again support the popular GIF format.


-------------------

ATI
Cirrus Logic
Compaq QVision
Oak
Paradise/Western Digital
S3*
Trident
Tseng ET3000
Tseng ET4000
Video Seven
Weitek
XGA
or any VESA compatible chipset.

* Some S3 video cards require special command line
options in order to work properly with NeoPaint. If you
have an S3 chipset and you experience problems, contact
NeoSoft Technical support (541) 389-5489.

NOTE: There may exist either now or in the future, video
cards based on revisions of the above chipsets which may
not be recognized by this version of NeoPaint. If you
experience problems related to your video card, please
contact NeoSoft Technical support (541) 389-5489.

CGA USERS: Due to severe limitations inherent in their
design, CGA video cards are not supported. This includes
many Tandy 1000 systems which are essentially CGA.


-----------------
STARTING NEOPAINT
-----------------

For the steps below, we assume that you have installed
NeoPaint in the directory C:\NEOPAINT. If you installed
NeoPaint in a different DOS subdirectory, then substitute
that name for C:\NEOPAINT below.

o   Your mouse driver (usually MOUSE.COM) must be loaded
    before running NeoPaint. Please refer to your mouse's
    user manual for more information.

o   To change to the NeoPaint directory, at the DOS
    prompt (C:\), type CD\NEOPAINT and press Enter. This
    places you in the NeoPaint subdirectory.

o   Once you have switched to the proper directory,
    NeoPaint can be started from the DOS command line by
    typing NEOPAINT followed by the Enter key.


--------------------
COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
--------------------

You can specify several command options when starting
NeoPaint. An option consists of a slash (/) followed by
an option letter and information about that option.

LOADING NEOPAINT'S OVERLAY INTO EXPANDED MEMORY
-----------------------------------------------

USAGE:      /E

EXAMPLE:    NEOPAINT /E

PURPOSE:    NeoPaint's overlay file (NEOPAINT.OVR) can be
            loaded into expanded memory, thus speeding up
            execution of some NeoPaint functions. When
            exiting NeoPaint the overlay is removed from
            memory. This option requires approximately
            400K of expanded (EMS) memory.

NETWORK SETUP FILES
-------------------

USAGE:      /S[file]

EXAMPLE:    NEOPAINT /Sf:\users\cindy.set

PURPOSE:    Normally NeoPaint stores its setup information
            in the NEOPAINT.SET file in the NeoPaint
            directory. This file contains information
            about the default settings such as video mode
            and memory usage options. In a multi-user
            environment with PCs of vastly different
            configurations it is necessary to specify
            setup files for different users and/or
            different machine types. The /S option allows
            users to load NeoPaint with their own
            personalized setup file.

            For example: if Cindy keeps her personal files
            in the PAINT directory on her C: drive then
            she might start NeoPaint by typing:

            NEOPAINT /Sc:\paint\cindy.set

DISABLE DOS SHELL
-----------------

USAGE:      /H

EXAMPLE:    NEOPAINT /H

PURPOSE:    This option disables the DOS Shell selection
            from the File Menu.

DISABLE PREFERENCES
-------------------

USAGE:      /P

EXAMPLE:    NEOPAINT /P

PURPOSE:    This option disables access to the Set
            Preferences selection in the Options menu,
            thus preventing a user from changing the
            setup.

LOADING IMAGES FROM THE COMMAND LINE
------------------------------------

You can also load images into Neopaint directly from the
DOS command line. Simply run NeoPaint with the names of
the files you wish to load as parameters. For example:

NEOPAINT  C:\PCX\VANGOGH.PCX  C:\BMP\IRISES.BMP

You may load as many files as will fit on the DOS command
line.


------------------------------
NEOGRAB SCREEN CAPTURE UTILITY
------------------------------

Included as part of the NeoPaint Package is an easy-to-
use screen capture utility called NeoGrab. NeoGrab will
capture graphics or text displayed on your monitor and
convert it into PCX format files which may be used in
NeoPaint and other programs.

To load NeoGrab, at the DOS prompt type:

NEOGRAB [Options]

To capture a graphics or text screen, press <Ctrl> <Print
Screen>. A small prompt like the one below will appear in
the center of your screen:
ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
³ Press ENTER to capture entire screen, ³
³ F1 to select area or ESC to cancel.   ³
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
Press ENTER to capture the entire screen not including
the NeoGrab prompt. F1 will allow you to select a
rectangular portion of the screen using your mouse. Two
short beeps means the screen was captured successfully.
One long beep means an error occurred and the screen
could not be captured. An error will occur if you are in
an unsupported graphics mode or if your disk is full.
NeoGrab supports all standard video modes and most super
VGA modes so you shouldn't have any trouble using it with
popular software. NeoGrab will not, however, work with
Microsoft Windows.

Screen captures are stored as PCX files and placed in the
directory where the NEOGRAB.EXE file is located. Files
are numbered sequentially starting with 00000001. For
example the first captured screen will be named
00000001.PCX the second 00000002.PCX and so on. NeoGrab
will not delete files to make room - it simply selects
the next available file name in the sequence. Deleting
files is up to you.

NEOGRAB COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
----------------------------

You can specify several options when starting NeoGrab. An
option consists of a forward slash (/) followed by an
option letter.

ALTERNATE HOTKEY
----------------

USAGE:      /K

EXAMPLE:    NEOGRAB /K

PURPOSE:    Changes the hotkey from the default <Ctrl>
            <Print Screen> to <Alt> <Scroll Lock>. This is
            useful if another program is already using the
            default hotkey.

SPECIFY CAPTURE PATH
--------------------

USAGE:      /P[path]

EXAMPLE:    NEOGRAB /Pc:\pcx

PURPOSE:    This option allows you to specify a drive and
            directory for captured PCX images. By default
            captured screens are stored in the directory
            that contains the NEOGRAB.EXE file.

UNLOADING NEOGRAB
-----------------

USAGE:      /U

EXAMPLE:    NEOGRAB /U

PURPOSE:    Use this option to unload NeoGrab from memory.
            This will only work if NeoGrab is the last TSR
            loaded in memory.

BYPASSING THE NEOGRAB PROMPT
----------------------------

USAGE:      /B

EXAMPLE:    NEOGRAB /B

PURPOSE:    Causes NeoGrab to automatically capture the
            entire screen and does not display the "Press
            ENTER to capture the entire screen, or F1
            to..." message.


-------------------
OPTIMIZING NEOPAINT
-------------------

NeoPaint has been designed to run acceptably on a wide
range of DOS based systems and will automatically try and
take optimal advantage of all supported hardware
resources available to it. Some machines have processing
speed, disk space, and memory limitations which will
affect how NeoPaint can perform. Graphics programs by
their nature are demanding of system resources. Some
images, particularly 256 and 16 million color pictures in
larger sizes, can easily use more than 1 megabyte of
memory and storage space.

If you have a system with speed and memory limitations,
one or more of the following suggestions may offer
relief:

o   If you have a choice between configuring your
    system's memory as either EMS (expanded memory) and
    XMS (extended memory) on your system, use EMS for
    NeoPaint. Using EMS memory can dramatically speed up
    many NeoPaint functions including rotating, flipping
    and special effects.

o   If you're using a memory manager (such as QEMM,
    386Max or EMM386) that draws EMS and XMS from the
    same pool, turn EMS on and XMS off in NeoPaint.
    Select Options/Preferences/Miscellaneous from the
    main menu to modify NeoPaint's memory management.
    This will free up some valuable conventional memory
    and speed up many of NeoPaint's functions.

o   Turn off the UNDO command under the SET PREFERENCES
    selection in the OPTIONS menu. UNDO keeps a record of
    the image prior to the last change you made. This
    takes up memory. If your system has limited RAM and
    disk memory available, you may want to disable this
    in any case. If your system is limited to 640K of
    RAM, then UNDO may use your hard disk to store
    changed items. Using hard disk storage is slower than
    using RAM, and turning off UNDO will increase
    NeoPaint's performance.

o   Do not run NeoPaint as a DOS application under
    Windows. Windows will slow NeoPaint's execution, as
    Windows will still be using up your system's
    resources while NeoPaint is running. If you do need
    to run NeoPaint from Windows, use the included
    NEOPAINT.PIF file located in your NeoPaint directory.
    Refer to your Microsoft Windows documentation for
    more information about PIF files.

o   If disk storage space is a problem (and in many cases
    even if you have plenty of disk space) turn off the
    CREATE BACKUP FILES function in the PREFERENCES
    selection of the OPTIONS menu. Graphic files tend to
    take up a large amount of disk space, and creating a
    backup file (.BAK) each time you SAVE a picture can
    rapidly deplete the free space available on your
    drive. You might want to turn this feature back on,
    however, when working with particularly important
    images.

o   Try using the 640x480 VGA resolution in 16 colors as
    your default. Some video cards use a TSR program to
    display VESA compatible higher resolutions. Using a
    TSR program is a much slower method of interacting
    with your hardware.

o   When using the 3-D OBJECT icon, use the Wire Frame
    mode.

o   Turn the PREVIEW option off for STAMP PAD images.

If none of the above seem to help, you may wish to
consider upgrading your system's hardware. Four hardware
options are listed below, in ascending order of cost:

o   Add 2 or more megabytes of (RAM) memory to your
    system. NeoPaint supports both the XMS and EMS
    specifications.

o   Add a larger, faster hard drive.

o   Upgrade your CPU.


--------------------------
ACQUIRING ADDITIONAL FONTS
--------------------------

NeoPaint comes with a variety of fonts. Additional fonts
are available from NeoSoft. Our Font Pack contains three
720K diskettes full of typefaces. The ORDRFORM.TXT file
located in your NeoPaint directory contains pricing and
ordering information for the Font Pack.

Third party software that can generate GEM screen fonts
(used by the DOS version of Ventura Publisher) may also
be used to create fonts for NeoPaint. Simply follow the
program's instructions for generating screen fonts. Copy
the fonts to your NeoPaint directory and rename them so
that they use the .GFT extension.

The NeoSoft Bulletin Board also contains a utility
program that converts Microsoft Windows True Type fonts
into NeoPaint compatible fonts. Our BBS is open 24 hours
at (541) 383-7195 (N81,300-14.4)


---------------------------
ACQUIRING ADDITIONAL STAMPS
---------------------------

If you're interested in acquiring additional stamps for
NeoPaint's Stamp Pad tool - you're in luck! NeoSoft has
created a NeoPaint Stamp Collection with tons of high
quality professional stamps. The ORDRFORM.TXT file
located in your NeoPaint directory contains pricing and
ordering information for the Stamp Collection.


-----------------------------
SPECIAL EFFECT CONSIDERATIONS
-----------------------------

With the advent of 15, 16 and 24 bit color, NeoPaint now
includes a number a new special effects. Without the
restrictions of 16 and 256 color fixed palettes these
effects can produce spectacular results. However, if you
are working with 16 or 256 color images, the palettes
used by these images will greatly influence the effect
and in some cases produce totally unexpected results.


----------------------
MOUSE DRIVER MYSTERIES
----------------------

If your mouse behaves strangely when using NeoPaint, you
may need to update your mouse driver software. Problems
such as an invisible cursor or a pointer that leaves a
trail of pigment on the screen are typical of certain
older mouse drivers. Contact the computer store where you
purchased your mouse or the manufacturer for information
about updating your mouse driver.


--------------
PROBLEM IMAGES
--------------

NeoPaint is designed to read and write the popular PCX,
TIFF, BMP and GIF file formats. We tested literally
hundreds of images during the design phase of NeoPaint.
However, even with the best testing, it's entirely
possible that there are some images that either don't
follow the rules or employ a compression algorithm that
is not supported by NeoPaint.

During our research we discovered, much to our surprise,
that there is no real consensus or standard among
programs that use 16 Color TIFF images. Images created by
one program frequently cannot be loaded by another
program. With NeoPaint we employed what we believed to be
the most popular format for 16 color TIFF images. If you
have problems using 16 color TIFF images with other
programs, try saving them as PCX, BMP or GIF files
instead. 2 color and 256 color TIFF images are not
effected by this problem.

Another dilemma facing connoisseurs of TIFF images is the
fact that there are so many different types. At last
count there were over 30 distinct dialects of TIFF. It
would be a tremendous task for NeoPaint to support all
those varieties. Even the most expensive image processing
software only support a few TIFF formats. So if you run
across a TIFF image that is unreadable then you may need
to translate it into a more basic format first. Better
yet use PCX, BMP or GIF files! All formats, PCX, BMP,
TIFF and GIF, are exactly the same when it comes to image
quality, but vastly different when if comes to
compatibility.

If you happen to run across an image file in either PCX,
TIFF, BMP or GIF format that you are unable to load with
NeoPaint, upload the file to our BBS (541) 383-7195
(N/8/1/300-14.4) or place the image on a diskette and
mail it to:

NeoSoft Corp.
Customer Support
354 NE Greenwood Avenue, Suite 108
Bend, Oregon 97701-4631

Include a brief note describing the image, where it came
from and if possible what program was used to create it.
