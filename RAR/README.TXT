                 Command line 32-bit RAR for DOS and OS/2
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Introduction

   This package is 32 bit RAR version for DOS and OS/2. Unlike 16 bit
RAR/DOS it is able to create archives using dictionaries larger
than 64KB. This version is the command line only, full screen interface
is not supported. It works under OS/2 as native OS/2 application
handling long names and extended attributes. It also understands
long file names in Windows DOS box (except Windows NT), but it is
strongly recommended to use the native Win32 console rar.exe from
WinRAR package under Windows, which is more reliable and has better
performance in Win32 environment.

   RAR/DOS32 is built by EMX C compiler and uses RSX DPMI extender.
EMX can be downloaded from ftp://ftp-os2.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/dev/emx/v0.9d
RSX - from ftp.uni-bielefeld.de/pub/systems/msdos/misc
